Data Modeller is a collaborative web application that helps product and analytics teams capture business context, generate data models with OpenAI assistance, and share the resulting documentation.

## What it does

- **Guided drafting**: Assemble prompts from domain context, settings, and change history to generate entity-relationship models.
- **Impact visibility**: Compare each draft with the previous version to highlight additions, removals, and review notes.
- **Change tracking**: Record manual adjustments as change sets for compliance and audit needs.
- **Export automation**: Produce markdown dictionaries and PlantUML diagrams for downstream consumers in a single click.

## Who it serves

- **Product and analytics partners** use the UI to curate domains, request drafts, and review the resulting impact analysis.
- **Engineering teams** extend the service with new workflows, exporters, and integrations while maintaining a common data model.

## Quick orientation

- Launch the Flask server with `flask --app app.py --debug run` and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to explore the UI.
- Store configuration and secrets in a local `.env` file; the application automatically loads it on startup.
